		<h4 id="vocadbdescription">What is VocaDB?</h4>
			<p>Vocaloid DataBase is aimed to be a specialized and unified source of information about Vocaloid songs, albums and producers.</p>
			<p>Wiki, blogs and forums aren't suitable for storing, managing and effective search through a net of crosslinks between songs, producers, circles, vocaloids and PV's, and that information is scattered and duplicated across many websites in different languages.</p>

		<h4 id="vocaloiddescription">Short description</h4>
			<p>Vocaloid is a unique subculture of user-created content (music, illustrations, videos, software, games, cosplay, events), based on voice synthesizers and their mascots.</p>
			<p>Vocaloid synthesizer software is a digital musical instrument to create human vocals, allowing anyone to have their personal virtual singer.</p>
			<p>The first Vocaloid "singers" Leon and Lola were released in 2003 in english language, but weren't successful. Vocaloid technology became popular in 2007 in Japan with the japanese voicebank "Hatsune Miku" (first V2 in Japan, second V2 in world after Sweet Ann).</p>
			<p>Being a great and fresh combination of a decent V2 voicebank and a snazzy boxart illustration, Hatsune Miku gained unexpected, unprecedented and massive success and became the symbol of all Vocaloid technology and subculture.</p>
		<h4 id="whyjapan">Why in Japan?</h4>
			<ul type="circle">
				<li>The simplest language for synthesis in the world: japanese has syllable-based phonetics, no accents and no rhyme concept in poetry</li>
				<li>Popular anime style (moe catalyst)</li>
				<li>A lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Djin" title="">dōjin</a> (self-published) activity</li>
				<li>Traditional high-pitched female vocal</li>
				<li>Diverse and active musical scene, a lot of indie musicians</li>
				<li>Pop-idols and virtual pop-star concepts in anime (Sharon Apple in "Macross Plus", 1994)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Japan happened to be the best country for a popularity breakthrough of the Vocaloid technology.</p>
		<h4 id="vocaloidfeatures">Features of Vocaloid</h4>
			<ul type="circle">
				<li>Vocaloid synthesizer software is treated as a musical instrument, so is free to use for any purpose.</li>
				<li>Piapro license initiative from Crypton Future Media permits the non-commercial usage of mascot images.</li>
				<li>Decentralization. Noone commands the community what and how to do. All content (music, videos, illustrations) is created by users themselves for their own purposes (fun, self-expression, selling).</li>
				<li>Collaboration of song writers, musicians, illustrators, animators and programmers.</li>
				<li>Self-promotion of Vocaloids and producers. Basically, the community choose Miku and made her popular (same with GUMI).</li>
				<li>Sharing of music and support principles. Most of Vocaloid music and videos are freely available on NND, Piapro and YouTube, still we support producers by buying their albums. It is possible for and being done by people who live outside Japan, too. Musical instruments, hardware, software and learning cost a lot, and producers are mostly indie musicians, so every sold cd is important for them. If you really like the music that was done by a Vocaloid producer, please support him.</li>
				<li>Concerts.</li>
			</ul>
